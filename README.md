## Purpose & Motivation

The research and analysis are part of the group project for course STAT-615 Regressions, instructed by Professor Laura B., at Mathematics & Statistics Department, the College of Art and Science, American University. The final project report has been submitted and reviewed by the Data Science Board and Program Development at American University.

In this research, we focused on eco-tourism development in Tanzania. As the tourism sector is on the road to recovery after severe effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing the possibility of a rebound while encouraging and optimizing its socio-economic development becomes more appealing and key in the current climate. The research and studies on tourism activities will help the local authorities and governments assess the viability of the sector and current economic incentives.


## Data Source

The original dataset is consolidated surveillance data collected by the Tanzanian National Bureau of Statistics based on 7 tourism points across the country. The data was collected to gain a better understanding of the status of tourism sector and provide an instrument that will enable sector growth.

The original dataset is distributed through a competition on the Zindi African Data Science Community. We encourage any users or readers who review our research project directly access and extract the dataset from Zindi Community's platform.
